Provides a user-interface component for browsing through the set of
configured servers for editing / making connections.

To use, create an instance of pqServerStartupBrowser, and connect its
serverConnected() signal to a slot.  If the user selects a server
and a connection is established, the slot will be called with the
new pqServer object that encapsulates the connection.
