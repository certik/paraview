# This is the single-file distribution of SQLite version 3.3.16.  You
# can read more about it at www.sqlite.org.  In a nutshell, SQLite is
# a compact implementation of most of SQL92 that can be easily
# embedded within C and C++ applications.  The authors have placed its
# code in the public domain so that it may be used for any purpose.
# You can access SQLite databases through vtkSQLiteDatabase and
# vtkSQLiteQuery.
#


#
# NOTE: To convert the sqlite3 distribution files into these, I
# renamed sqlite3.c and sqlite3.h into vtk_sqlite3.c and vtk_sqlite3.h.
# Then I went into each file and did a string search-and-replace from
# sqlite3 to vtk_sqlite3.h.  Finally, I removed the copy of sqlite3.h 
# from the beginning of vtk_sqlite3.c.
