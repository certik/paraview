# - Find Tcl includes and libraries.
# This module finds if TCL is installed and determines where the
# include files and libraries are. It also determines what the name of
# the library is. This code sets the following variables:
#  TCL_FOUND          = Tcl was found
#  TK_FOUND           = Tk was found
#  TCLTK_FOUND        = Tcl and Tk were found
#  TCL_LIBRARY        = path to Tcl library (tcl tcl80)
#  TCL_LIBRARY_DEBUG  = path to Tcl library (debug)
#  TCL_STUB_LIBRARY   = path to Tcl stub library
#  TCL_STUB_LIBRARY_DEBUG = path to debug stub library
#  TCL_INCLUDE_PATH   = path to where tcl.h can be found
#  TCL_TCLSH          = path to tclsh binary (tcl tcl80)
#  TK_LIBRARY         = path to Tk library (tk tk80 etc)
#  TK_LIBRARY_DEBUG   = path to Tk library (debug)
#  TK_STUB_LIBRARY    = path to Tk stub library
#  TK_STUB_LIBRARY_DEBUG = path to debug Tk stub library
#  TK_INCLUDE_PATH    = path to where tk.h can be found
#  TK_INTERNAL_PATH   = path to where tkWinInt.h is found
#  TK_WISH            = full path to the wish executable
