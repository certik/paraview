  // Description:
  // This is the layout method where the graph that was
  // set in SetGraph() is laid out. The method can either
  // entirely layout the graph or iteratively lay out the
  // graph. If you have an iterative layout please implement
  // the IsLayoutComplete() method.

  // I'm an iterative layout so this method lets the caller
  // know if I'm done laying out the graph
