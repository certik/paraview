/* This is not a traditional header file, but rather a "macro" file that
 * defines the body of a decompression function.  In general, there are
 * many flavors of the decompression functionality which differ only
 * slightly.  Rather than maintain lots of different code bases or try to
 * debug big macros, we just include this file with various parameters.
 *
 * The following macros must be defined:
 *	COMPRESSED_BUFFER - the buffer that holds the compressed image.
 *	READ_PIXEL(pointer) - reads the current pixel from the pointer and
 *		increments the pointer.
 *	INCREMENT_PIXEL() - Increments to the next pixel.
 *	INCREMENT_INACTIVE_PIXELS(count) - Increments over count pixels,
 *		setting them all to appropriate inactive values.
 *
 * The following macros are optional:
 *	TIME_DECOMPRESSION - if defined, the time to perform the
 *		decompression is added to the total compress time.
 *
 * All of the above macros are undefined at the end of this file.
