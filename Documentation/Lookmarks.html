<h2>Creating a Lookmark</h2>
<p align="center">

</p>
<p>
A lookmark may be created in one of two ways. Selecting "Create Lookmark"
from the Tools menu will create a lookmark of the active view (highlighted in
red), while pressing the "lookmark button" in the upper left corner of a
render view will create a lookmark of that view. In either case, the user
must enter a (unique) name for the lookmark in the dialog box that appears
and can (optionally) add a text description that will be stored with the
lookmark. Clicking the Create button will store a copy of the
lookmark. Lookmarks created in one ParaView session are available in
subsequent ParaView sessions unless they are deleted. (Accessing stored
lookmarks and deleting existing lookmarks are discussed later on this page.)

<h2>Lookmark Toolbar</h2>
<p>
One way to access lookmarks in the user interface (UI) is through the
lookmark toolbar.  It is located on the right side of the ParaView
application window by default, and it contains buttons when lookmarks have been
created. It contains an icon for each lookmark. Hovering your mouse over an
icon in the toolbar will display the lookmark's name in a help balloon, while
right-clicking an icon will give the user the option to delete that lookmark,
edit its properties (by displaying the Lookmark Inspector), create a new
lookmark (by displaying the "Create Lookmark" dialog), or display the
Lookmark Browser. Left-clicking on an icon in the lookmark toolbar will apply
that lookmark in the selected view.

<h2>Lookmark Browser</h2>
<p align="center">

</p>
<p>
The Lookmark Browser is available from the right-click menu in the lookmark
toolbar and from the View menu. It contains a list of all lookmarks available
in the current ParaView session, and it is useful for a couple of
reasons. Using the buttons at the top of the browser, you may export (to a
file) or delete multiple lookmarks at once as well as import lookmarks from a
file. Importing lookmarks will concatenate them to the end of the lookmark
browser. Double-clicking an item in the browser will apply that lookmark to
the selected view. Finally, if the Lookmark Inspector (see next section) is
open at the same time as the Lookmark Browser, the inspector will display the
properties of the currently selected lookmark in the browser.

<h2>Lookmark Inspector</h2>
<p align="center">

</p>

<p>
The Lookmark Inspector (View menu, Lookmark Inspector) displays the
properties of a lookmark. The lookmark that it displays is changed by either
selecting a new item in the Lookmark Browser or by choosing "Edit" in the
right-click menu of an item in the Lookmark Toolbar. From the lookmark
inspector, the user can apply the lookmark in the active view or delete it
entirely by using the buttons at the top. The Pipeline View portion of the
lookmark inspector displays the pipeline that has been saved in the lookmark
and that will be generated when the lookmark is applied. The name and
description of a lookmark can be edited, but the "Save" button must be
pressed for these changes to take effect. The user also has control over two
properties of how lookmarks behave when they are applied. When a lookmark is
created, the time value and camera properties in the selected view are stored
in the lookmark. When the lookmark is applied, these saved values (time value
and/or camera properties) can be restored. This behavior is controlled by two
checkboxes at the bottom of the Lookmark Inspector. By default, neither of
these values is applied with the lookmark. If the user marks or unmarks one
of these checkboxes, then the Save button must be pressed for the changes to
take effect next time the lookmark is applied.

<h2>Applying a Lookmark</h2>
<p>
Thus far we have skirted the issue of what happens when a lookmark is
applied. A lookmark can be thought of as a custom filter plus displays. It
has inputs and thus must be applied to one or more existing sources
(depending on how many non-filter sources exist in the lookmark's
pipeline). So how are its inputs determined? In the case where the lookmark
has one input, the source that is selected in the Pipeline Browser is the
input to the lookmark. If nothing is selected, the user is prompted to select
the source from the pipeline to which the lookmark will be applied. If the
lookmark contains two or more inputs, the user will be prompted automatically
to specify which existing source to use for which input to the lookmark. The
input to a lookmark can be either a reader, a source (i.e. an item from the
Source menu), or a filter. Once the input is determined, the state of the
lookmark's pipeline (which includes the pipeline filters, their display
properties, and underlying properties of how ParaView is handling rendering)
is simply loaded into the selected view. The parameters and display
properties of the input(s) to the lookmark are not modified with one
exception: point and cell arrays (attributes) that were turned on in the
reader from which the lookmark was created are turned on in the reader of the
pipeline to which it is applied. Lookmarks are applied to the selected view;
thus the visibility of the sources they generate are off in all other
existing views.
