<p>
From the File menu, you may load and save various types of files in ParaView. It also allows you to connect to and disconnect from one or more servers and to exit the application.

<a name="Open"/>
<h2>Open</h2>
<p>
Selecting Open from the File menu displays a file browser for selecting a
file or group of files containing data to load into ParaView. The data files
must be located on the server to which ParaView is connected. (When using the
builtin server -- the default -- this is the local machine where
ParaView is being run.)
<p>
If the file extension for the data file being opened is not recognized by
ParaView, another dialog box will appear, from which you may select which
reader is appropriate for loading your data.

</p>

<a name="RecentFiles"/>
<h2>Recent Files</h2>
<p>
This entry is a sub-menu containing a list of files recently opened in
ParaView. The files are grouped according to the server on which they
reside. The files in the list include data files and state (.pvsm) files.

<a name="LoadState"/>
<h2>Load State</h2>
<p>
Load a .pvsm file to set the ParaView server's state. The state of the user
interface is then updated to match that of the server. Such a file may be
created by using the Save State entry in the File menu. (See <a
href="FileMenu.html#SaveState">Save State</a> below.)

<a name="SaveState"/>
<h2>Save State</h2>
<p>
Capture the state of the ParaView application from the point of view of the
server(s). The user interface's state can be re-created from that of the
server.

<a name="SaveData"/>
<h2>Save Data</h2>
<p>
Save to a file the output of the source, reader, or filter selected in the <a
href="PipelineBrowser.html">Pipeline Browser</a>. The list of file formats
available changes depending on the dataset type. See the list of all
available <a href="ParaViewWriters.html">writers</a>.

<a name="SaveScreenshot"/>
<h2>Save Screenshot</h2>
<p>
Save to a file the contents of the selected view (highlighted in red). The
formats supported are PNG, BMP, TIFF, PPM, JPG, and PDF. This option is not
supported for the Spreadsheet view.

<a name="SaveAnimation"/>
<h2>Save Animation</h2>
<p>
See <a href="Animation.html#SaveAnimation">Saving Animations</a> on the Animation page.

<a name="SaveGeometry"/>
<h2>Save Geometry</h2>
<p>
See <a href="Animation.html#SaveAnimation">Saving Animations</a> on the Animation page.

<a name="Connect"/>
<h2>Connect</h2>
<p>
Selecting this option allows you to connect to an external server. This may
exist already, or you may launch it by specifying a command in the Configure
Server dialog (discussed below) before connecting to it.

<p>
If you are already connected to an existing server (including the builtin
server -- running only the ParaView client), and you have loaded data or
created a data set from the Sources menu, when you click the Connect button,
the dialog shown below will appear. Click the "Yes" button to continue with
the process of connecting to a server.

<p align="center">
<img src="DisconnectReconnectDialog.png"/>
</p>

<p>
Next the Choose Server dialog will appear. This dialog box shows any servers
to which you have previously connected (assuming you did not delete the
server's entry). If the server you want is already listed in the dialog box,
left-click its name to select it, and click the Connect button at the bottom
of the dialog box.

<p align="center">
<img src="ChooseServerDialog.png"/>
</p>

<p>
If the desired server is not in the list, click the "Add Server" button to
add it to the list. The dialog box shown below will appear. Enter a name in
the first text entry box; this is the name that will appear in the Choose
Server dialog.

<p align="center">
<img src="ConfigureNewServerDialog.png"/>
</p>

<p>
Next select the type of connection you wish to establish. The possibilities
are as follows. The "reverse connection" entries mean that the server
connects to the client instead of the client connecting to the server. This
may be necessary when the server is behind a firewall. Servers are usually
run with multiple processes and on a machine other than where the client is
running.

<ul>
<li>Client / Server: Attach the ParaView client to a server.</li>
<li>Client / Server (reverse connection): Connect a server to the ParaView client.</li>
<li>Client / Data Server / Render Server: Attach the ParaView client to separate data and render servers.</li>
<li>Client / Data Server / Render Server (reverse connection): Attach both a data and a render server to the ParaView client.</li>
</ul>

<p>
In either of the client / server modes, you must specify the name or IP
address of the host machine (node 0) for the server. You may also enter a
port number to use, or you may use the default (11111). If you are running in
client / data server / render server mode, you must specify a host machine
for the data server and another one for the render server. You will also need
two port numbers. The default one for the data server is 11111; the default
for the render server is 22221.

<p>
When all of these values have been set, click the Configure button at the
bottom of the dialog. This will cause the Configure Server dialog box to
appear. You must first specify the startup type. The options are Command and
Manual. If the server has not already been started outside of the ParaView
user interface, select the Command option. To connect to an already-running
server, select the Manual option. In this case, there is nothing else to
specify, so click the Save button at the bottom of the dialog.

<p align="center">
<img src="ConfigureServerManualDialog.png"/>
</p>

<p>
If you use the Command option, in the text window labeled "Execute an
external command to start the server", you must give the command(s) and any
arguments for starting the server. This includes commands to run the server
in parallel (e.g., mpirun). The executable for the server used in client /
server mode is pvserver. The ones used in client / data server / render
server mode are pvdataserver and pvrenderserver, respectively. You may also
specify an amount of time to wait after executing the startup command(s) and
before making the connection between the client and the server(s). (See the
spin box at the bottom of the dialog.) When you have finished, click the Save
button at the bottom of the dialog.

<p align="center">
<img src="ConfigureServerCommandDialog.png"/>
</p>

<p>
Clicking the Save button will return you to the Choose Server dialog. The
server you just configured will now be in the list of servers you may
choose. To connect to a server, left-click its name to select it, and click
Connect. To make changes to settings for a server, select it, and click Edit
Server. To remove a server from the list select it, and click Delete Server.

<p>
You may also save and/or load servers to/from a file using the Save Servers
and Load Servers buttons, respectively, on the Choose Server dialog. If you
choose not to connect to a server, you may click the Close button at the
bottom of the Choose Server dialog rather than selecting a server and
clicking Connect.

<p>
Once the new connection has been formed, the entry at the top of the Pipeline
Browser will change to indicate the new server.
</p>

<a name="Disconnect"/>
<h2>Disconnect</h2>
<p>
When connected to an external server, selecting this option causes ParaView to
disconnect from that server. Before actually disconnecting, ParaView displays
the dialog box shown below, giving you the chance to verify that you actually
wish to disconnect. Disconnecting from all servers causes ParaView to run in
Builtin mode (i.e., as a stand-alone application). When you disconnect from a
server, the datasets on that server will no longer be available in the
ParaView application window.

<p align="center">
<img src="DisconnectDialog.png"/>
</p>

<p>
This functionality is also available on the <a href="ViewMenu.html#MainControls"Main Controls</a> toolbar.
</p>

<a name="Exit"/>
<h2>Exit</h2>
<p>
Choose this option to close the ParaView application.
