<p>
ParaView is a scalable, open-source visualization application. The
application runs on a wide variety of platforms, ranging from a
single-processor desktop machine to multi-processor shared-memory
supercomputers or clusters of computers. When run in a parallel environment,
ParaView can process very large data in a wide variety of data formats
(structured and unstructured, time varying and static).

<p>
ParaView provides a comprehensive suite of visualization algorithms and
supports many different file formats for both loading and exporting
datasets. This application is extensible, so new algorithms can be easily
added. ParaView 3 is more quantitative and data-centric than previous
versions of ParaView, providing more plotting and charting functionality as
well as allowing easier access to the data values underlying the
visualization.
