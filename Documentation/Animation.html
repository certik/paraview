<p>
In ParaView, animation refers to changing the parameters of a reader, source,
filter, or the camera (viewing position) over time. The interface provided
for creating an animation is the Animation Inspector. It can be displayed by
selecting Animation Inspector from the View menu.

<h2>Animation Toolbar</h2>
<p align="center">
<img src="AnimationToolbar.png"/>
</p>

<p>
The animation playback toolbar (View menu, Toolbars submenu, VCR Controls)
provides VCR-like buttons for moving through an animation that has already
been created. These buttons are also available in the Animation menu.

<br>
<table class="PropertiesTable" border="1" cellpadding="3">
<tr><td><img src="VCRFirst.png"></td><td>Go to the beginning of the animation.</td></tr>
<tr><td><img src="VCRBack.png"></td><td>Go to the previous frame in the animation.</td></tr>
<tr><td><img src="VCRPlay.png"></td><td>Play the animation.</td></tr>
<tr><td><img src="VCRPause.png"></td><td>Pause playing the animation. This button is available while an animation is playing. In addition to pausing the animation, pressing this button causes the Play button to reappear.</td></tr>
<tr><td><img src="VCRForward.png"></td><td>Go to the next frame in the animation.</td></tr>
<tr><td><img src="VCRLast.png"></td><td>Go to the end of the animation.</td></tr>
<tr><td><img src="VCRLoop.png"></td><td>When pressed, the animation plays in a loop. To stop the looping behavior, press this button again. The animation will stop when the end of the animation is reached.</td></tr>
</table>

<h2>Playback</h2>
<p>
The current time can also be changed by useing the Current Time entry box
and/or spinbox in the Playback section at the top of the Animation Inspector.

<p>
The animation can be played in three modes: Sequence, Real Time, and Snap To
TimeSteps. The mode can be changed by selecting the appropriate mode in the
Play Mode drop-down menu. In Sequence mode, the animation is played as a
sequence of images (or frames) generated one after the other rendered in
immediate succession. The number of frames is controlled by the "No. Of
Frames" spinbox. Note that the frames are rendered as fast as possible. Thus
the viewing frame rate depends on the time needed to generate and render each
frame.

<p>
In Real Time mode, the "Duration (secs)" spinbox (replacing the "No. Of
Frames" spinbox) indicates the time in seconds over which the animation
should run. Each frame is rendered using the current wall clock time in
seconds relative to the start time. The animation runs for exactly the number
of seconds specified by the "Duration (secs)" spinbox. In turn, the number of
frames actually generated (or rendered) depends on the time to generate (or
render) each frame.

<p>
In Snap To TimeSteps mode, the number of frames in the animation is
determined by the number of time values in the dataset being animated. This
is the animation mode used for ParaView's default animations: playing through
the time values in a dataset one after the other. Default animations are
created by ParaView when a dataset with time values is loaded; no action is
required by the user to create the animation.

<p>
The Current Time for the animation ranges between the Start Time and the End
Time values specified in the Playback section of the Animation
Inspector. When animating datasets that contain time values, only the time
values that fall in the range of the Start Time and End Time values will be
part of the animation. By default, as datasets containing time values are
loaded into ParaView, the Start Time and End Time values are modified so that
they contain the union of all the time ranges in all the datasets loaded so
far. To turn off this behavior, mark the "lock" check box beside the Start
Time and/or End Time entry boxes to keep the start time and end time,
respectively, from being modified when new datasets are loaded. By default,
both lock check boxes are unmarked, so playing through an animation will play
through all time values in all loaded datasets. This is the desired behavior
in most cases.

<h2>Track Selection</h2>
<p>
The combination of a particular selected object (reader, source, filter, or
camera) and an animateable property within that object is called a track. The
user creates key frames in a track. The values of the key frames and the
interpolation between key frames control how the property value is modified
over time as the animation plays. The Track Selection section of the
Animation Inspector provides a means to select a particular track for
editing.

<p>
All created readers, sources, filters, and the camera are listed in the
Selected Object drop-down menu. Once a Selected Object is chosen, all the
available properties of that selected object that can be animated are listed
in the Property To Animate menu. Both the Selected Object and the Property To
Animate must be selected in order to edit key frames.

<h2>Key Frame Editor</h2>
<p>
The Key Frame Editor section shows the properties of a key frame in the track
chosen in the Track Selection section. If no key frames have yet been added
in the selected track, the user interface for the Key Frame Editor section is
grayed out, with the exception of the Add Key Frame button.

<p>
The Add Key Frame and Delete Key Frame buttons can be used to add or delete a
key frame from the selected track. When the Add Key Frame button is pressed
in a track with no key frames, two key frames are added, which default values
being set for the second key frame. The first key frame can only be deleted
if it is the only key frame in a particular track.

<p>
The different key frames in a given track can be selected using the Key Frame
Index spinbox. The Key Frame Time entry box is used to change the time at
which the key frame takes effect. When the Start Time and End Time values
change, the Key Frame Time of each key frame is scaled so that the key frames
fill the entire range from Start Time to End Time. The Interpolation
drop-down menu controls how the value of the key frame is interpolated from
one key frame to the next. Consequently, interpolation for the last key frame
has no effect and is disabled. The Value controls depend on the type of the
property being animated by the selected track. For example, min and or max
buttons become availabe next to the Value entry box if the property being
animated has min and/or max bounds defined.

<p>
When adding key frames for animating the camera (viewing position), the key
frame value section provides spinboxes for specifying several different
parameters of the camera. There is also a "Use Current" button below these
spinboxes. Clicking this button fills the spinboxes with the associated
values of the camera in the selected view. This way, it is possible to
interactively choose the desired camera parameters for the key frame. To
animate the camera in another view, first change to that view, and then add
new key frames associated with that camera.

<p>
ParaView supports four different types of interpolation of values between key frames.<br>
<table class="PropertiesTable" border="1" cellpadding="3">
<tr><td><img src="Ramp.png"></td><td>Linearly interpolate from one key frame value to the next.</td></tr>

<tr><td><img src="Exponential.png"></td><td>When using Exponential interpolation, the key frame value will be interpolated from this key frame to the next one according to the specified exponential function. The Base, Start Power, and End Power must be specified; user interface controls for this appear when Exponential interpolation is chosen. The interpolation of the exponents is linear, so the interpolation from Base ^ Start Power to Base ^ End Power is exponential.</td>

<tr><td><img src="Sinusoidal.png"></td><td>The Sinusoidal interpolation type varies the value from this key frame to the next one according to the specified sine function. The Phase, Frequency, and Offset must be specified from the user interface controls that appear when Sinusoidal interpolation is selected.</td>

<tr><td><img src="Step.png"></td><td>For Step interpolation, use the key frame value from the time this key frame takes effect until the time for the next key frame is reached. At that point, immediately use the next key frame value.</td>
</table>


<h2>Animation Settings</h2>
<p>
The Cache Geometry check box (the only control in the Animation Settings
section) enables/disables whether caching is to be used while playing the
animation. Note that caching is only in effect when playing in Sequence mode
or Snap To TimeSteps mode; it has not effect in Real Time mode. When checked,
the geometry is cached and used whenever available while playing the
animation. Note that if the geometry being animated is large, it will not be
possible for multiple copies of the geometry (one per timestep) to be stored
in memory. On the General tab of the Active View Properties tab in the
Settings dialog box (Edit menu, Settings), there is a spinbox labelled "Cache
Limit (in KBs)"; it specifies the maximum cache size per process to use for
caching geometry for an animation. If while playing the animation, the cache
size exceeds this limit, geometry caching is disabled.

<h2>Saving Animations</h2>
<p>
Once an animation has been created in ParaView, the animataion may be saved
as an AVI file or as a series of image files (JPEG, TIFF, or PNG), one image
per animation frame. This functionality is available by choosing Save
Animation from the File menu. When a movie file or series of images is saved,
all of the views in the ParaView application window are captured. Additionally,
the geometry per animation frame may be saved by selecting Save Geometry from
the File menu. The data will be written out using ParaView's PVD file format.
