The pipeline browser, usually displayed in the upper left corner of the user
interface, provides information about ParaView's current visualization
pipeline. A visualization pipeline begins with either a reader or a source,
and filters may be applied to it. Additional filtering operations may be
performed on the output of the filter(s). Also more than one reader or source
may have been added to the ParaView session. The pipeline browser shows how
the readers, sources, and filters are connected together. It allows easy
access to any of the readers / sources / filters and their output.

<p>
To the left of each reader, source, or filter in the pipeline browser is an
eye icon that indicates whether the resulting dataset is visible in the
selected view (outlined in red). A dark eye icon indicates the dataset is
visible; a gray one indicates it is not. Left-clicking on an eye icon toggles
the visibility of the associated dataset in the selected view.

<p>
At the top of the pipeline browser is the name of the server to which
ParaView is connected (or "builtin" if running ParaView stand-alone). Below
the server name is the name of the server is a tree structure containing the
name of every reader, source, or filter that has been added to the
visualization pipeline. The server is shown as the root of the tree
structure, and the readers and sources are at the first level down from the
server. A filter applied to a given reader or source is at the next level
down from it, and subsequent filters are added at increasingly lower
levels. In the pipeline browser image shown above, multicomb_0.vts and
RTAnalyticSource1 are at the first level below the server. Contour1, which
was applied to multicomb_0.vts, is at the next level below this reader. Then
both ExtractHistogram1 and ExtractEdges1 were applied to Contour1, and they
are at the level below Contour1 in the tree structure.

<p>
Left-clicking on a reader, source, or filter in the pipeline browser selects
it and displays the appropriate Properties, Display, and Information tabs in
the object inspector. The name of the selected item in the pipeline browser
may be changed by left-clicking the selected item (reader, source, or
filter), typing a new name, and pressing Enter.

<p>
Right-clicking anywhere in the pipeline browser displays a menu from which
you can open a new data file (the same operation as selecting <a
href="FileMenul.html#Open">Open</a> from the File menu). If the mouse is
positioned over a reader, source, or filter when the right mouse button is
pressed, the menu also contains options for creating a custom filter and for
deleting the reader, source, or filter (only active if this item is at the
end of the visualization pipeline). If a filter is right-clicked, the menu
also contains an option to change the filter's input.

</p>

<p>
Right-clicking Contour1 from the pipeline browser example shown above and
selecting Change Input causes the Input Editor to be displayed. From this
dialog, the input to a filter can be changed. In this example, the
possibilities for input to the contour filter are multicomb_0.vts and
RTAnalyticSource1; the input editor does not allow the creation of loops in
the visualization pipeline. Left-clicking on one of the possible inputs in
the Select Source window causes the Pipeline Preview window to show what the
contents of the pipeline browser would be if the input was changed in this
way. Clicking OK causes the input to change.
