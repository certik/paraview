<p>
From the Edit menu you can control settings for ParaView, undo and redo
various actions, change the pipeline topology, and determine how the mouse
interacts with the 3D view.

<a name="UndoRedo"/>
<h2>Undo / Redo</h2>
<p>
Undo the last action (or redo the last undone action) performed in ParaView
not related to changing the point of view or orientation for viewing data in
a 3D view. This is the same functionality provided by the <a
href="ViewMenu#UndoRedoControls">Undo/Redo controls</a> toolbar.

<a name="UndoRedoCamera"/>
<h2>Undo / Redo Camera</h2>
<p>
Undo the last camera-related action (or redo the last undone action of this
type). Camera-related actions include changing the viewpoint for looking at
the data in the 3D scene (rotating, panning, zooming, selecting one of the
axis-aligned views) or changing the orientation for viewing the data
(rolling).

<a name="ChangeInput"/>
<h2>Change Input</h2>
<p>
Choose a new input for the item selected in the Pipeline Browser. This only
works for filters in the pipeline since sources and readers do not have
inputs.

<p>
See the <a href="PipelingBrowser.html#ChangeInput">Change Input</a> section
of the Pipeline Browser page for more information.

<a name="Delete"/>
<h2>Delete</h2>
<p>
Remove the item selected in the Pipeline Browser from the visualization
pipeline. This can only be done if the selected item is at the end of the
pipeline (i.e., no filters are connected to it).

<a name="DeleteAll"/>
<h2>Delete All</h2>
<p>
This option removes any readers, sources, or filters you have created. This
is the equivalent of going to the Properties tab for each data set and
pressing the Delete button or selecting each data set in the Pipeline Browser
and selecting Delete from the Edit menu (see above) for it.

<a name="Interact"/>
<h2>Interact</h2>
<p>
Click and drag in a 3D view to change the point of view or orientation for
viewing the data set.

<a name="SelectCellsOn"/>
<h2>Select Cells On</h2>
<p>
Draw a selection rectangle to select cells located on the surface of a data
set.

<a name="SelectPointsOn"/>
<h2>Select Points On</h2>
<p>
Draw a selection rectangle to select points located on the surface of a data
set.

<a name="SelectCellsThrough"/>
<h2>Select Cells Through</h2>
<p>
Draw a selection rectangle to select cells through a data set regardless of
their depth relative to the visible surface.

<a name="SelectPointsThrough"/>
<h2>Select Points Through</h2>
<p>
Draw a selection rectangle to select points through a data set regardless of
their depth relative to the visible surface.

<a name="Settings"/>
<h2>Settings</h2>
<p>
Selecting this option displays a dialog box that controls the settings for
the ParaView application as a whole. In the left column of the dialog box is
a tree structure for selecting which settings to view and/or change.

<a href="ViewSettings"/>
<h2>View Settings</h2>
<p>
The View Settings entry in the Edit menu displays a dialog for changing
properties of the selected view. The contents of this dialog change depending
on which view type is selected.
